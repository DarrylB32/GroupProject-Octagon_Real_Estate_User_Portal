Similar to real companies like [ProMove](https://www.promove.com/), Octagon Real Estate (ORE) is a fictitious company that focuses on a personalized home buying experience. ORE uses the information you provide alongside advanced search technology to weed out unwanted listings and create a personalized portfolio of homes that match your criteria. This project focuses on creating and designing the personalized portfolio or [user portal](Static/WebBased/realestate.html) that the customers will interact with. Below is the profile for our test family:
